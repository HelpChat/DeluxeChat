# DeluxeChat
## About
DeluxeChat allows you to create endless customizable chat formats that add "hover tooltips" and also suggest/execute command on click to your chat!

This plugin should be compatible with most chat spam/chat utility plugins but it will override your chat format to be displayed through the formats defined in the DeluxeChat config.yml. (This will override any essentials chat formats/chat channel plugins to display the DeluxeChat format)  
DeluxeChat is made to handle all aspects of how your chat formatting looks.

## Chatformat and priority
Chat formats are loaded from the config.yml and are tied to permission nodes.  
To give a player/group a specific/custom chat format, you will need to give the player/group the permission `chatformat.<yourFormatIdentifier>`.

If a player has multiple chat format permissions available, the chat format priority will determine what format should be active for the player/group.  
You can assign the priority of each chat format!

## TownyChat
DeluxeChat is also fully compatible with Towny. It will work alongside TownyChat so you can manage your chat channels within TownyChat and allow DeluxeChat to handle your chat formatting. If you would like To use TownyChat integration, there is only one requirement. In your Towny channels.yml you must add a new option to every channel - hooked: true​

```yaml
    general:
        commands: [g]
        type: GLOBAL
        channeltag: '&f[g]'
        messagecolour: '&f'
        permission: 'towny.chat.general'
        craftIRCTag: 'admin'
        range: '-1'
        hooked: true
```

You can find an example-config [here](https://github.com/help-chat/DeluxeChat/tree/master/configs/config.yml)!

## Placeholders
DeluxeChat 1.12.0 or higher uses any placeholder provided by [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/).  
You must have PlaceholderAPI installed on your server for DeluxeChat 1.12+ to work.

Information on pre 1.12.0 placeholders below  
[click for DeluxeChat pre 1.12.0 placeholders](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/deluxechat-placeholders/)

[Maximvdw](http://www.spigotmc.org/resources/authors/maximvdw.6687/) was kind enough to share all of his placeholders with his plugin MVdWPlaceholderAPI and they are available to use if you have purchased any of his plugins that have placeholders included in them.

You must have one of the following plugins installed and the plugin [MVdWPlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/mvdwplaceholderapi.11182/) installed to use his placeholders:

[Tab](http://www.spigotmc.org/resources/tab.1448/)
[ActionBar](http://www.spigotmc.org/resources/actionbar.1458/)
[TitleMotdAdvanced](http://www.spigotmc.org/resources/titlemotdadvanced.1629/)
[FeatherBoard](http://www.spigotmc.org/resources/featherboard.2691/)
[AnimatedNames](http://www.spigotmc.org/resources/animatednames.2175/)
[DynamicSigns](http://www.spigotmc.org/resources/dynamicsigns.3566/)

To enable his placeholders, make sure you meet the requirements above, and simple enable the hook by setting:  
```yaml
hooks:
  mvdw_placeholderapi: true
```
After this is done, you can begin using his placeholders with the following placeholder format:
```yaml
%mvdw_<placeholder without brackets>%
```

**Example**:​
```yaml
    prefix_tooltip:
    - 'Maxims placeholders from MVdWPlaceholderAPI:'
    - 'name: %mvdw_player%'
    - 'Plugin count: %mvdw_pluginscount%'
    - 'Ram: %mvdw_usedram% / %mvdw_freeram%'
```

## Known issues/Bugs
The latest version of DeluxeChat is compatible with Bukkit/Spigot 1.9/1.10/1.11/1.12  
for older version support check the version history tab. those old versions are available but no longer supported.

If you want support for any problems, bugs, or features, it is expected that you are running the latest version of DeluxeChat on a 1.9 or higher server!

This plugin modifies chat completely to send tooltip messages and allow clickable chat format parts! There may be some incompatibility issues with other chat related plugins...

If you are using a plugin such as Factions, make sure all Factions chat config options are set to false or it will override DeluxeChat and you won't see your DeluxeChat formats when talking in chat!
